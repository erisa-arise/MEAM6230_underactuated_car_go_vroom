Reactive Car
=============

This repository provides a package containing an adaptive and reactive neural controller for an Ackermann car system.

### Install and Build Package:
```
git clone https://github.com/erisa-arise/MEAM6230_Underactuated_ODE.git
cd MEAM6230_Underactuated_ODE
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

### Notes on running the package:
To launch the neural controller, first run the neural controller node:

```
ros2 run reactive_car neural_controller.py
```

Initialize the car somewhere along the nominal trajectory, then generate the nominal trajectory:

```
ros2 service call /generate_nominal_trajectory reactive_car/srv/GenerateNominalTrajectory
```

The car will immediately begin to follow the generated nominal trajectory.


### Notes on data:
The data/ directory includes all the demonstrations collected as well as several ros2 bags. The /utils directory contains several processing scripts that were used to parse the ros2 bags as well as recreate the plots shown in the report.
